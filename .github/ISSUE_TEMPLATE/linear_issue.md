## Objective
Review this repository and complete the next highest-value improvement using the Conxian GitHub review baseline.

## Repo focus
[Repository name]

## Baseline review context
Known cross-org concerns:
- public/private separation risk
- possible sensitive config exposure such as `.env`
- tracked generated/runtime artifacts such as:
  - `node_modules`
  - `test-results`
  - `playwright-report`
- inconsistent governance and repo standards
- missing files may include:
  - `README`
  - `LICENSE`
  - `SECURITY.md`
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  - `CODEOWNERS`
  - changelog / release guidance
- weak release/versioning discipline
- unclear public-facing purpose/status

## Task for agent
Inspect this repository, research further, and choose exactly one high-value, self-contained task.

Priority:
1. Security exposure or public/private boundary risk
2. Sensitive files or generated artifacts tracked in git
3. Missing ignore rules or CI hygiene
4. Missing governance files
5. README / public-facing clarity improvements
6. Release/versioning improvements

## Required workflow
- inspect the repo before making changes
- select one task only
- record evidence for why it was selected
- implement the change fully
- run relevant validation
- update all related docs
- prepare approval-ready notes

## Deliverables
- selected task
- why it was chosen
- evidence found
- files changed
- validation results
- documentation updated
- follow-up items
- approval note

## Constraints
- do not expose or commit secrets
- if likely secrets are found, prioritize remediation and note required rotation/manual follow-up
- avoid broad speculative refactors
- prefer minimal, high-confidence changes
- improve existing governance/docs rather than duplicating them

## Definition of done
- one meaningful repo improvement completed
- relevant validation performed
- docs updated to match
- ready for human approval
